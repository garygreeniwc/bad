# Delivery at Infinity Works

## Our Cultural Manifesto

This document explains what it means to lead delivery at Infinity Works; our core values, how we approach our work and the tools we use to do so. It should reveal what it means to work for Infinity Works and to work with Infinity Works.

## Values

Our values:

- Awareness
- Discipline
- Empowerment
- Transparency
- United
- No blame culture
- Pragmatism

### Awareness

Be aware of value. This could be the value of a story in a backlog, the value of the product to the customer or the value of the client to Infinity Works.

Every deliverable in the Product Backlog should have value, either immediately or enabling future value, otherwise why are we delivering it? We need to be able to measure that value either as commercial value (revenue or profit) or relative to other Product Backlog Items (PBIs).

Be also commercially aware for Infinity Works. We sometimes need to have honest conversations at or with our clients, be sensitive to your environment. Be disruptive, but in a positive and conscious way, mindful of the culture and attitudes your customer currently holds.

### Discipline

We use discipline to drive common good practices and capabilities. We leverage elements from existing frameworks like; Scrum, Kanban, Scrumban, Disciplined Agile (DA), Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), Spotify and Nexus to help forge that structure. We use these to construct lightweight and flexible frameworks to suit each organisation.

Don't be a slave to "best practices", innovate and experiment, even if they sometimes fail, the learning is what we value most.

### Empowerment

We believe that ideas, answers and innovation comes from everyone, not just a lucky few. Autonomy and empowerment are critical to Infinity Works, and are core to how we function.

Some clients will be further on the autonomy journey than others. Please be patient and work with clients to build trust and promote an empowered environment. We often find that trust is needed first and the best way to win trust is to have a say..do approach; we say what we're going to do, then do it. If we hit a bump in the road, we say that too.

### Transparency

Transparency, honesty and visibility are core to how we deliver at Infinity Works. Many of the tools and techniques are crafted to help promote this and act as information radiators both physically in our client offices and virtually within our tools.

We should never fear an honest conversation!

### United

We are one team, with one purpose, to deliver great products that delight our customers, warring departments and precious silos kill team productivity and purpose.

> _"Left to themselves the components of a system (silos) become selfish and competitive and this behavior has a destructive effect on the system"_ **- W. Edward Demming**

Business and IT are one unit, not two. IT's prime objective is to further and influence business strategies and objectives, whilst at the sametime, be good custodians of business technology. We are not separate, we are the same and need to work together daily and with our customers and stakeholders to deliver the best possible solutions we can.

Equally, we at Infinity Works are one team. We all have specialisms and have had different routes and experience that lead us to Infinity Works. We value and promote this. There is rarely one true path, rather many potential paths.

### No blame culture

We are here to deliver value to our clients, so we should always consider the big picture. If something cannot be delivered due to a failed dependency we should seek to resolve the dependency rather than pointing fingers.

Infinity Works doesn't do "that's not our problem", we'd rather pitch in and get things delivered.

### Pragmatism

All projects have different constraints and different ideas about what good looks like. Our approach is not to be dogmatic about following any particular best practice, or achieving any pre-conceived notion of quality. Instead we seek to understand the constraints within which we're working and build systems to the best of our ability within this. Compromise is inevitable and presenting the different trade-offs confidently and objectively allows us to work towards an approach that everyone agrees with.

## How we do things

We use techniques and frameworks Scrum, Kanban, Scrumbam or anything else that promotes visibility, gathers metrics to help us improve the flow of work and helps our customers deliver great software. For scaling or more rigid formal environments, we have the Blended Agile Framework or BAD (see [link[www.bad.tools]]). BAD provides a structured delivery framework that stresses early risk reduction via customer feedback, proof of concepts and prototypes. It is phased based on Disciplined Agile and tries to reduce the risk of building the wrong product.

Resources will be provided on the above via confluence and the web as well as coaching and training from the Delivery Community of Practice (Slack Channel: cop_delivery_internal).

## The tools we use

### Right Tools For the Job

We are independent of all software vendors and do not have financial incentives to recommend one product over another. Similarly we are not a "one trick pony" that will always recommend the same solution, no matter what the problem.

We value tools that provide us with visibility, especially when distributed over multiple locations, whether that be backlogs or metrics that help our teams understand the flow of work better. We have a cloud first strategy, as we believe they can reduce time and cost to implement and reduce the overall cost of delivery and operations.

Typical tools:

- JIRA
- Confluence
- Trello
- Slack
