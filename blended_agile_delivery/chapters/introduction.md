# Introduction

Creating and evolving enterprise software products is complex and littered with many failures.  Whether that be overruns or just building a product every hates.  Even great companies can create poor software, think Apple's MobileMe, eventually replaced by the far superior iCloud.

This book is a work of collaboration by many experienced enterprise software delivery professionals with decades at the coalface in the software industry, with the bruises scars to prove it.  We have learnt how to apply techniques and practices to help software delivery be more rapid, repeatable and predictable.  We call this framework; Blended Agile Delivery or BAD for short.

Our aim is to deliver awesome software that delights our customers and employers.  Not only that, but to avoid delivering poor user experience, that on paper seemed a good idea, but once launch failed to capture and engage our customers.  We call this a No More Pet Projects approach and use a variety of techniques to avoid this.

Blended Agile Delivery consists of a core set of values and principles, processes and practices to follow, tried and tested tips and techniques from highly successful professionals as well as experiments that you can try to help you better understand your environment and how to apply a Lean / Agile delivery approach to getting great software products out to your customers.

One point to stress; this is a journey, not a destination.  You cannot read this book and be an expert, even if implement the tools in this book a few times and get some success.  We, including the authors of this book, are all continually learning and adapting.  What may work in one situation, may not in another and we need to be able to adapt to each situation and context.  This book will help with suggestions and tools that you can try, but context, culture and environment is key to finding the right tool to use and how to apply it.

> **Please Note:**  This book is intended as a guide, not to be implemented by route.  The creators and authors of Blended Agile Delivery value pragmatic adoption oftool and techniques and experimentation to help understand each specific environments challenges and potential solutions.

Much of this book and Blended Agile Delivery leverages the learning from some of software deliveries leading practitioners and thinkers.  Where we do, we’ll call that out and point you in their direction for more information.
