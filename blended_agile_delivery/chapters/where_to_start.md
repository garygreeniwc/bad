# Where to start

Before rushing to implement the tools, techniques and practices in this book, first we must consider the foundations. These are the values and principles that underpin the Blended Agile Delivery framework.

> _A "principle" is acceptance of something as truth or a belief that a certain standard or rule is not up for debate. A "value" is a person's personal belief for or against something._

**Please Note:** If you do not live by the values and principles we state here, then please do not attempt to use the Blended Agile Delivery framework. You may get some success, but will not be truly successful and we desperately want to help you succeed.

> _"A people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both."_ - **Dwight D. Eisenhower**

## Values

- Be Aware
- Be Disciplined
- Be Empowered
- Be Transparent
- Be United

### Be Aware

Blended Agile Delivery values awareness (environment, culture, competitors, customers needs, team needs) to drive delivery and ensure we build the right products for our customers. We use tools such as:

- Market insights
- Analysis on our competitors
- Innovation incubators (such as; hackathons, ShipIt days & FedEx days)
- Minimal Viable Product (MVP), what is the minimum we can do to maximise customer feedback
- Use Cost of Delay (CoD) to help Product Owners, Product Managers and Squads make informed decisions and prioritise early realisation of value and return on investment

Every deliverable in the Product Backlog needs to have value, either immediate or enabled future value, otherwise why are we delivering it? We need to be able to measure that value either as commercial value (revenue or profit) or relative to other Product Backlog Items (PBIs).

### Be Disciplined

We use discipline to drive common good practices and capabilities. We leverage elements from existing frameworks like; Disciplined Agile (DA), Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Large Scale Scrum (LeSS), Spotify and Nexus to help forge that structure. We make these to construct a lightweight and flexible to suit each organisation.

We value clear accountabilities but share responsibilities. That means there is always an accountable team member, but they don't necessarily deliver the item. They could facilitate collaboration and teamwork to make that happen.

We promote a healthy balance between consistency and innovation, holding a core set of common practices but consciously innovating and experimenting with new ideas and approaches to help evolve those practices and learn.

Blended Agile Delivery strives for predictability, but without buffers, padding or gaming the system. Product delivery is complex and unpredictable at times increasing variability in delivery, Blended Agile Delivery makes that visible and plan for it by decomposition of risk and front load risk into Discovery and Inception.

### Be Empowered

In the Blended Agile Delivery framework, we believe that ideas, answers and innovation comes from everyone, not just lucky few. Much of the 21st centuries organisations are built on concepts from the Victorian era, such as Taylor's Scientific Method for management, developed in the last two decades of the 19th century.

Tailor believed that thinking and working should be separated and the art of the manager was to get the ideas of the thinkers into the hands of the workers as efficiently as possible. These were days of an educated elite and an uneducated majority. It was an age of industrialisation where previously artezan skills were standardised and automated on an epic scale. This meant the elite designed and built machines that could be operated, sometimes at great risk, by the majority. We see it today with Architecture teams separated from delivery (sometimes called ivory tower architecture), with separate design teams from delivery team and with Project Managers micro-managing teams and team members.

You may have also seen product team filling in forms or documents and handing over to IT to deliver. This is a form of Taylorism where we demote our creative teams to simply order takers with little or no opportunity to partner or innovate.

> _"We (The East) will win and you (The West) will lose. You cannot do anything about it, because your failure is an internal disease. Your companies are based on Taylor's principles. Worse, your heads are Taylorized, too. You firmly believe that sound management means executives on one side and workers on the other, on one side men who think, and on the other side men who can only work. For you, management is the art of smoothly transferring the executive's' ideas to the workers' hands"_ **- Konosuke Matsushita - Founder of Panasonic**

Now the environment has changed. We have an educated majority and an industry full of talented, intelligent people educated to our highest levels, with degrees, masters and PHDs. We are not operating machines, toiling with manual labour. We are engaged in cognitive creation, where every piece of work it unique. Taylor's principles simply do not work when applied to this context.

Consider also the work of Dan Pink (<http://www.danpink.com/>), a noted economist and author who developed the book "Drive, the surprising truth about what motivates us". He presented the research of many prominent psychologists, scientists and economics leaders and cites, with evidence, autonomy as one of the three intrinsic motivators for cognitive workers (along with purpose and mastery). More on motivation techniques later.

### Be Transparent

Transparency, honesty and visibility are core to Blended Agile Delivery. Many of the tools and techniques are crafted to help promote this and act as office and virtual information radiators. Software delivery has long been dogged with barriers from preventing engineers and technologists from being honest with our business partners. Equally, this has lead to unfortunate consequences from our partners where trust is eroded, then partnership, then empowerment.

We should not fear an honest conversation!

> **Example:** We were asked to plan a £17m programme and come up with and end date for a customer, using a new set of team that had never worked together before, new technology never used before and at a scale never experience for my the business. We had to be honest, I could create a structure and roadmap, but not date. We had no empirical metrics or past history to provide guidance on velocity or pace. We had to have that honest conversation and agree to a three month experiment. Let the teams work on the backlog for three months so we could gather metrics and foster a culture of continual improvement. It worked, after three months we had empirical data to inform us of what we could really achieve.

Transparency has another positive consequence; it builds trust. If we have a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement, we should not fear others see us, at times, stumble, as long as we learn from it and alter path (more on this later).

### Be United

We are one team, with one purpose, to deliver great products that delight our customers, warring departments and precious silos kill team productivity and purpose.

> _"Left to themselves the components of a system (silos) become selfish and competitive and this behavior has a destructive effect on the system"_ **- W. Edward Demming**

Business and IT are one unit, not two. IT's prime objective is to further and influence business strategies and objectives, whilst at the sametime, be good custodian of business technology. We are not separate, we are the same and need to work together daily and with our customers and stakeholders to deliver the best possible solutions we can.

Equally, great IT teams are units of of multi-skilled professionals who adapt to incoming work, are not precious about their core skills and able to muck in as needed to further the objectives and goals of the team and business. This means that we need teams of "Generalising specialists" that have mastery over a set of core skills, but are also able to be practitioners of other skills that support the team.

Lastly, we believe in communities of practice that help share both success and failure and build and evolve practices and toolkits to support their practitioners. We believe in no best practice, just good practices that will evolve and develop over time. Communities are used to foster communication, coaching, pairing and innovation. They are hierarchy-less and blameless.

## Principles

> _A "principle" is acceptance of something as truth or a belief that a certain standard or rule is not up for debate._

We believe that enterprise software delivery needs principles to follow. These principles are fixed.

- Agile
- Lean
- Focused
- Incremental
- Structured

### Agile

Blended Agile Delivery is an Agile framework, in that it applied the Agile Manifesto to guide it (<http://agilemanifesto.org/>). If we are not abiding by the Agile Manifesto in totality, then we are not utilising the Blended Agile Framework.

The Agile Manifesto provides us with additional values and principles. Much is documented on the Agile Manifesto, so we will not go into detail here, but here's a refresher Values

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

> - Individuals and interactions **over** processes and tools
> - Working software **over** comprehensive documentation
> - Customer collaboration **over** contract negotiation
> - Responding to change **over** following a plan

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

**The Big Misconception:** Firstly, let me cover what is often the biggest misconception of the Agile Manifesto. The above says we value the items on the less more than the ones on the right. This does not mean that we don't always do the things on the right, but rather we just value the behaviours on the left more.

#### Twelve Principles

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

### Lean

Lean Manufacturing was developed for Toyota, formerly known as The Toyota Production System (TPS), primarily by Sakichi Toyoda, his son, Kiichiro Toyoda and Taiichi Ohno, a production engineer from the 1940s onwards. It was renamed to Lean Manufacturing in the 1990s. Put simply, Lean means the elimination of waste.

Lean Manufacturing was implemented to optimise a chain of dependent events that deliver some item of value to a customer. It was quickly adopted within the IT industry (and others) to help optimise software delivery processes, which also adopt a chain of dependent events (Requirements / Needs, technical design, development, test, make available to the customer and support)

Lean has 5 key principles:

- Identify Value from the perspective of the customer
- Map the Value Stream, that is, identify the steps to deliver the value to the customer
- Create Flow, implement the value stream via closely linked steps that emphasise smooth flow to the customer
- Establish Pull, let customers and workers pull work, rather than it be pushed onto them and overload them
- Seek Perfection, continuously review and identify improvements to the process

Lean introduces many of the tools and concepts we will cover, for example; Kanban, principles of flow, continuous improvement, just in time, etc.

### Focused

The Blended Agile Delivery framework focuses on two key areas; Value and Risk. Our goal is to increase value rapidly whilst decreasing risk rapidly too. We achieve this by early and lightweight experimentation.

For example, one technique we use is the £50 Starbucks experiment. A small team creates paper prototypes of a proposed product or feature and takes them to the nearest busy coffee shop and offer to buy customers their coffee for 5 minutes of their time. We use this time to help validate if the prototype makes sense, is intuitive and would provide value.

Additionally, if we have new technology, we'll produce early working features to prove our pace and capability to deliver. This provide empirical data to guide our planning early on in the product's life-cycle.

### Incremental

We believe in getting a product in front of our customers as soon as possible. It may have limited functionality, it may not have all the bells and whistles, but we need feedback to guide us before we move further forward and risk more expense based on potentially incorrect assumptions.

The goal of this is to learn. Consider the Innocent brand of smoothies and health foods, founded by three Cambridge University graduates in 1999.

Before they committed to leaving their jobs, they sell their first smoothies from a stall at a music festival in London. A sign above the stall reads "Should we give up our jobs to make these smoothies?" and people are asked to throw their empties into bins marked 'Yes' or 'No'. ('Yes' wins.)

They are now a significant international company providing soothies around the world.

Consider the work of Henrik Kniberg and his 2016 blog "Making sense of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – and why I prefer Earliest Testable/Usable/Lovable".

See: (<http://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp>) for more details.

### Structured

Blended Agile Delivery believes that structure is needed to promote autonomy & purpose and also accountability and responsibility. One difference. structure is not hierarchical like in SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) which can cause a separation between thinkers and doers, rather RRPD utilised autonomous units working in coordination to a common goal.

Key structural elements are based on the highly successful Spotify model with concepts of autonomous Squads grouped into product or value stream Tribes with Guilds acting as community of practices and Chapters acting as focus groups or core capability groups. This also aligns to the Large Scale Scrum (LeSS) framework with Products and Product Areas and SAFe with value streams and Release Trains.

Structure allows us to scale almost indefinitely and assists with coordinating distributed teams and specialties. Structure is essential, but also evolves as the challenges and organisation evolves. We have clear accountabilities but share responsibilities.

We often use elements of the Spotify Model developed by Henrik Kniberg and Anders Ivarsson. This introduces the concept of structural elements such as; Squads, Tribes, Guilds and Chapters, more about these later.
