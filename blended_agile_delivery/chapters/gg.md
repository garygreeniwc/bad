# About the authors

## Gary Green

I stumbled across Blended Agile Delivery when working at the awesome Infinity Works in Leeds.  As at 2017, Infinity Works is a rapidly growing Agile DevOps consultancy providing support, development, coaching and training to small to large enterprises across the UK.  We, the authors are standing on the shoulders of others, primarily Tom Walton and Austen Bell who are the main creators of Blended Agile Delivery.  Sure we’ve influenced it and even added to it, but cannot claim to be the inventors.

I joined the profession of enterprise software delivery practice as a developer in 1987, a time where punch tapes, enormous disk drives the size of bus steering wheels boasted a capacity of 16 MB and a single computer could fill a server room and still had rows of switched and flashing lights.

Over time, as I began to master the art of engineering (at least as it was back then) I started to focus on how we deliver great software, not the engineering, but the path from idea to delivery to the customer.  I’d been taught Software Engineering and Waterfall was the way, but truly struggled to see these as the best path.

In the early 90’s I started to work with customers who struggled to share their vision up front and started using iterative techniques to evolve solutions to fit the customer needs, using both 3GL and 4GL languages, similar to prototyping, but the prototypes were working software.  What I found was that building, learning and adapting incrementally really worked.  I loved it and my customers and stakeholders loved it.  I even often sat with them and created screens and reports on the fly side by side with them.

Later that decade I moved into the Object Oriented world and started using elements of the RUP (Rational Unified Process) and UML.  Finally in the 2,000’s Gary stumbled on Agile and Scrum via a friend and has never turned back.

I have worked on many significant projects and programmes with budgets up to £70m, and 100’s of team members, as; Scrum Master, Scrum of Scrum Master, Project Manager and Programme Manager.  He is fluent in SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework), LeSS (Large Scale Scrum), DA (Disciplined Agile), Scrum, Nexus (scaled Scrum), Kanban and Scrumban as well as numerous other techniques.

I am a practitioner of Blended Agile Delivery and have used successfully several times in varying environments.
